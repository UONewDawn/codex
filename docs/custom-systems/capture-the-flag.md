Experience team-based PvP in New Dawn's classic Capture the Flag system. Coordinate with your team in 10v10 battles to capture the enemy flag while defending your own in fast-paced 20-minute matches.

!!! info
    This mode is heavily influenced by WoW's Warsong Gulch.

## Overview

Capture the Flag (CTF) brings structured, team-based PvP to New Dawn with rules inspired by classic games like World of Warcraft's Warsong Gulch. Players compete in organized matches with clear objectives, earning points for their performance and contributing to their team's victory.

## How to Join

### Sign-Up Process

## Game Rules

### Objective

Capture the enemy's flag and return it to your base **3 times** to win, or have the most captures after 20 minutes.

### Win Conditions

1. **First team to 3 captures** wins immediately
2. **After 20 minutes:** Team with most captures wins
3. **If tied on captures:** Team with most points wins
4. **If tied on points:** Draw (rare)

### Flag Mechanics

**Picking Up the Flag:**

- Touch the enemy flag at their base to pick it up
- Cannot hide while carrying the flag
- Cannot use stealth while carrying the flag
- Flag carrier has **120 seconds** to capture before they're killed

**Dropping the Flag:**

- Flag drops when carrier is killed
- Flag carrier can manually drop by using flag on themselves (5-second pickup penalty)
- Dropped flags return automatically after **5 seconds** unless picked up

**Capturing the Flag:**

- Must bring enemy flag to your base
- **Your flag must be at your base** to score
- If both flags are being carried, neither team can score
- After capture: **20-second delay** before flags can be grabbed again
