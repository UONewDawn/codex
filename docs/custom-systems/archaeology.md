# Archaeology System

Uncover lost artifacts and treasures from Britannia's forgotten past through the Archaeology system. Follow clues found throughout the world, excavate ancient dig sites, and discover rare items hidden beneath the ruins of civilization.

## Overview

The Archaeology system allows adventurers to hunt for and excavate historical artifacts from ruined locations across New Dawn. By deciphering clues and using specialized tools, archaeologists can uncover items ranging from common historical relics to ultra-rare treasures.

## Getting Started

### Finding Clues

Clues to dig sites come in two forms:

**Map Fragments (Fishing):**

- Can be fished up from any body of water
- More common in deep water
- Rare chance from shore fishing
- Must be deciphered before use

**Journal and Book Pages (Combat):**

- Drop randomly from monsters (similar to treasure maps)
- Various creatures throughout Britannia
- Must be deciphered before use
- Drop rate scales with creature difficulty

### Obtaining Tools

Purchase an **Archaeologist's Tools bag** from any provisioner:

- **Archaeologist's Shovel** - For initial excavation
- **Archaeologist's Pick Hammer** - For detailed work  
- **Archaeologist's Brush** - For final cleaning

All three tools are required to complete an excavation.

## Deciphering Clues

Before you can excavate, you must decipher your clue:

**Map Fragments:**

- Requires **70+ Cartography**
- Higher skill = higher success chance
- Failed attempts don't consume the fragment
- Success reveals the dig site location

**Journal/Book Pages:**

- Requires **70+ Inscription**
- Higher skill = higher success chance
- Failed attempts don't consume the page
- Success reveals the dig site location

!!! tip "Skill Matters"
    The higher your Cartography or Inscription, the better your chances of successfully deciphering clues and the better your odds at finding rare artifacts during excavation.

## Excavation Process

Once you've deciphered a clue, travel to the indicated location and begin excavation. The process has three stages:

### Stage 1: Untouched (Shovel)

- Use your **Archaeologist's Shovel** on the dig site
- Requires **80+ Mining** skill
- Higher Mining increases success chance
- Removes surface dirt and debris
- Advances to Stage 2 on success

### Stage 2: Excavated (Pick Hammer)

- Use your **Archaeologist's Pick Hammer** on the site
- Requires **90+ Mining** skill
- Carefully chips away hardened earth
- Higher Mining skill improves success rate
- Advances to Stage 3 on success

### Stage 3: Cleared (Brush)

- Use your **Archaeologist's Brush** on the site
- Requires **80+ Item Identification** skill
- Gently brushes away final debris
- Reveals the artifact(s)
- Higher Item ID improves artifact quality chance

!!! warning "Clue Consumption"
    Clues are consumed after use, whether successful or not. Make sure you're prepared before starting!

## Artifacts and Rarity

### Rarity Tiers

Artifacts are categorized into four rarity tiers:

**Common (40-50% chance):**

- Historical items of moderate value
- Basic relics and everyday objects from the past
- Lowest gold value
- Good for beginning archaeologists

**Uncommon (10-20% chance):**

- More interesting historical pieces
- Decorative items with some value
- Moderate gold value
- Desirable collectibles

**Rare (1-5% chance):**

- Significant historical artifacts
- Unique items with high value
- Sought after by collectors
- Can fetch high prices

**Ultra-Rare (0.1-0.5% chance):**

- Legendary artifacts of immense value
- Extremely powerful or unique items
- Museum-quality pieces
- The ultimate goal for dedicated archaeologists

### Factors Affecting Rarity

Your chance of finding better artifacts is influenced by:

1. **Mining Skill:** Higher skill = better base chances
2. **Cartography Skill:** Bonus for map-based digs
3. **Item Identification Skill:** Bonus during final brush stage
4. **Site Quality:** Some dig sites have better loot tables
5. **Luck:** RNG always plays a role

### Common Finds

Not every dig produces a rare artifact. Archaeologists frequently discover:

- Broken pottery shards
- Rusted tools
- Worn coins
- Fragments of text
- Common household items from ruins

These are part of the authentic archaeology experience and provide some gold value while you search for that ultra-rare find.

## Dig Site Locations

Dig sites are scattered throughout New Dawn, typically in or near:

- Ruined towns and settlements
- Ancient battlefields
- Abandoned structures
- Historical landmarks
- Areas affected by the Codex War

Each clue will direct you to a specific location. Some areas may have better artifact pools than others.

## Strategy & Tips

### Skill Requirements Summary

- **80+ Mining:** Required for Stage 1 and Stage 2
- **90+ Mining:** Better success at Stage 2
- **70+ Cartography:** Decipher map fragments (bonus to artifact chance)
- **70+ Inscription:** Decipher journal pages (bonus to artifact chance)
- **80+ Item Identification:** Required for Stage 3 (bonus to artifact quality)

### Optimal Build

An ideal archaeologist has:

- **100 Mining** - Maximum excavation success
- **100 Cartography** - Best map deciphering and artifact bonus
- **100 Item Identification** - Best artifact quality chance
- **100 Inscription** - Best journal deciphering
- Supporting skills: Magery (travel), Meditation

### Farming Tips

- **Fish for maps** during downtime
- **Hunt high-fame creatures** for better journal page drops
- **Stock multiple clues** before excavation trips
- **Mark runes** to dig site regions for quick travel
- **Group dig sites** geographically to save time

### Common Mistakes

- Attempting excavation without all three tools
- Not raising skills high enough (especially Mining to 90+)
- Rushing without proper preparation
- Not tracking which clue types lead to better sites

## Rewards Beyond Artifacts

While artifacts are the primary reward, archaeology also offers:

- **Gold value** from selling common finds
- **Rare decoratives** for housing
- **Historical knowledge** through item descriptions
- **Achievement progress** toward archaeology achievements
- **Trade opportunities** with other collectors
