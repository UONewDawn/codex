# Gardening System

Cultivate the land and manage livestock through New Dawn's comprehensive Gardening system. Grow crops, harvest resources, and maintain sheep for wool production in this agricultural addition to the classic UO experience.

## Overview

The Gardening system allows players to engage in agricultural activities beyond simple farming. Collect seeds from animals, cultivate plants, grow cotton and flax, and manage sheep for wool production. This system adds depth to resource gathering and provides alternative methods for obtaining crafting materials.

## Plant Cultivation

### Obtaining Seeds

Seeds are obtained from animals that naturally eat seed-bearing plants:

- Animals like bears drop seeds based on their diet
- Seed drops are chance-based when animals are killed
- Different animals drop different seed types
- Higher-level animals may drop rarer seeds

**Seed Types:**

- Crop seeds for farming
- Decorative plant seeds
- Special resource-bearing plants

### Fertile Dirt

To plant seeds, you need fertile dirt:

- **Source:** Animals that spend time in dirt (boars, etc.)
- **Chance-based drop** when animal is killed
- Required for planting seeds
- One fertile dirt per planting

### Planting and Growth

1. Use fertile dirt in a location you want to plant
2. Target the prepared soil with your seed
3. Wait for the plant to grow
4. Growth time varies by plant type
5. Harvest when mature

!!! tip "Location Matters"
Indoor plants may have different growth rates and requirements than outdoor plants. Experiment with placement.

## Cotton and Flax Farming

### Wild Cotton and Flax

Cotton and flax can be found growing naturally throughout the world:

- **New cotton and flax fields** are sprouting across Britannia
- Harvestable by all players
- Resource captcha checks may occur during farming
- Renewable resource that regrows over time

### Young Player Cotton

Special cotton fields exist specifically for young players:

- Only harvestable by players with young status
- Helps new players get started with tailoring
- Located in protected young player areas
- Cannot be harvested by veteran players

### Farming Mechanics

When harvesting cotton or flax:

- Use appropriate tool on the plant
- Receive cotton or flax in your pack
- **Resource captcha** may trigger (answer correctly to continue)
- Plant respawns after a delay
- Skill gains possible in related skills

## Sheep Farming

### Wool Production System

Sheep produce wool over time, but their production is affected by their environment and hunger level:

**Outdoor Sheep:**

- Produce wool every **2 hours**
- Natural environment is optimal
- Can graze and maintain health

**Indoor Sheep:**

- Wool production depends on hunger level
- Stacking sheep stops wool production entirely
- Must be properly maintained

### Hunger-Based Production

Indoor sheep wool production scales with hunger:

| Hunger Level | Food Points | Production Time |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| Well-Fed     | 18-20       | 1.5 hours       |
| Satisfied    | 10+         | 2 hours         |
| Peckish      | 5+          | 6 hours         |
| Hungry       | 2           | 8 hours         |
| Starving     | <2          | 12 hours        |

### Feeding Your Sheep

To maintain wool production:

- Feed sheep regularly with appropriate food
- Monitor hunger levels
- Keep sheep in proper conditions
- Don't overcrowd (stacked sheep don't produce wool)

!!! warning "Sheep Farms"
Simply stacking sheep in your house like "cordwood" won't work. You need to provide proper space and feeding to maintain wool production.

### Optimal Sheep Management

**Best Practices:**

- Keep sheep outdoors when possible (2-hour production)
- If indoors, maintain feeding schedule
- Don't stack multiple sheep in one tile
- Provide adequate space for movement
- Monitor hunger levels regularly

**Poor Practices:**

- Overcrowding sheep
- Ignoring hunger levels
- Indoor stacking without feeding
- No space for sheep to exist properly

## Farmers and NPCs

### Farmer NPCs

Farmers can be found in agricultural areas:

- Sell farming supplies
- Buy agricultural products
- Provide farming advice
- Random banter about farming life
- Some may sell seeds or fertile dirt

### Interactions

- Talk to farmers for tips
- Sell excess crops and materials
- Purchase farming supplies
- Learn about new farming techniques

## Resource Captcha

To prevent automated resource gathering:

- **Captcha checks** can trigger while farming cotton, flax, or other resources
- Answer the captcha correctly to continue
- Failure to answer prevents further gathering temporarily
- Gradually increasing chance rather than fixed timers
- Applies to various resource gathering activities

## Strategy & Tips

### Plant Cultivation Tips

- Hunt animals in diverse locations for varied seeds
- Keep fertile dirt stocked for planting opportunities
- Plant in accessible locations
- Mark rune to your garden locations
- Experiment with indoor vs outdoor growth

### Cotton/Flax Farming Tips

- Farm during off-peak times for less competition
- Keep bags organized for mass gathering
- Watch for captcha prompts
- Mark good farming locations
- Young players should utilize young-only fields

### Sheep Management Tips

- **Outdoor is best:** 2-hour wool production without feeding
- **Indoor requires work:** Keep them fed and happy
- **Space matters:** Don't overcrowd
- **Monitor hunger:** Check regularly
- **Plan feeding routes:** Efficient feeding schedule

### Common Mistakes

- Overcrowding indoor sheep
- Forgetting to feed indoor sheep
- Not checking hunger levels
- Expecting stacked sheep to produce wool
- Ignoring resource captchas (get timed out)

## Integration with Crafting

### Tailoring

- Cotton and flax for cloth production
- Wool from sheep for various items
- Resource for creating clothing and equipment

### Other Crafts

- Some seeds may provide resources for alchemy
- Decorative plants for housing
- Special resources for unique recipes

## Future Expansion

The Gardening system may expand to include:

- More crop varieties
- Advanced farming techniques
- Irrigation systems
- Seasonal crops
- Agricultural achievements
