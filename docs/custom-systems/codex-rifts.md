# Codex Rifts

In the decades following the Codex War, scholars studied the magical artifacts recovered from the fallen forces. Among their discoveries were strange, otherworldly creatures they called **rift spawns** — entities capable of tearing openings between realms and moments in time.

When these rift spawns are defeated, there is a chance a rift gate forms at the site of their death. These gates shimmer with fractured magic and open windows back to Britannia during the early dark days of the Codex War. Travelers who step through find themselves fighting in those battles — armies still clash, towns still burn, and Rift Masters command the assault from within.

## How Rift Gates Spawn

### Rift Spawns in the Overworld

Normal creatures throughout Britannia can spontaneously transform into **rift spawns** — visually distinct, enhanced versions with a random color hue and significantly buffed stats:

Higher-fame creatures convert more often. Champions, bosses, vendors, and escorts are exempt.

### Gate Formation

When a rift spawn is slain, it may tear open a **Codex Rift Gate** at its location:

- **Gate spawn chance:** 1% (lowest-fame creatures) scaling up to 50% (fame 32,000)
- Only players **within 16 tiles** of the kill are added to the allowed list and can enter
- The gate closes automatically after **45 seconds**
- Gates have a blue-purple glow and require no action beyond walking up to them

!!! warning "Entry Restrictions"
    - Players must have been within 16 tiles when the gate opened — latecomers cannot enter
    - Characters flagged as **Young** cannot enter
    - The standard dungeon instance rule applies: **one account per player** may be inside a Codex Rift at a time

!!! info "Entering the Gate"
    Step on the gate or double-click it. A confirmation prompt appears before you are transported.

## Inside the Rift

### Environment

You are transported to an instanced section of Felucca where a battle is actively raging.

- **Full Felucca ruleset** — PvP is enabled
- **Spell restrictions:** Recall, Mark, Gate Travel, and Teleport are blocked inside the rift
- Housing placement is not allowed

### Time Limit and Ejection

- You have **60 minutes** from when you entered before automatic ejection
- On ejection you are sent to **Dawn** (Event Center)
- Logging out removes you from time tracking; logging back in while still in the rift region ejects you immediately to the exit point
- A small timer gump displays your remaining time while inside

## Rift Locations and Champions

At any moment, up to **3 of the 8 rift locations** are active simultaneously. After a rift is completed (boss defeated), there is a **5–10 minute delay** before a new rift location can activate. The system checks every 30 seconds to activate a random inactive location when fewer than 3 are running.

Each active rift progresses through **a series of waves** — you must kill all required creatures in a wave to advance to the next. The final wave is the **Rift Master** boss.

## Rewards

### Rift Shards from Regular Creatures

While inside the rift, every creature killed has a chance to drop **1 Rift Shard** directly to the killer's hands (works through pets and controlled creatures too).

### Rift Shards from the Boss

When a Rift Master is defeated, shards are awarded to all players who dealt qualifying damage:

- The **top damager** receives the maximum number of shards for that rift master
- All other eligible players receive shards scaled proportionally
- Players who dealt insufficient damage receive a notice but no shards

### Artifacts

Rift Masters can drop a rare **artifact** item. Drop chance and loot tables are configured server-side. Two tiers exist:

- **Unique artifacts** — exclusive to that boss type
- **Shared artifacts** — common across all rift masters

If a drop occurs, the recipient is chosen at random weighted by damage contribution (more damage = higher chance to receive it).

### Monster Statues

Rift Masters can drop **decorative monster statues** in rift-themed hues. These are housing decorations; single-clicking one shows the creature's name.

## Strategy

### Finding Rift Gates

- Hunt monsters with naturally high fame: dragons, daemons, ancient liches
- Most rift spawns can appear anywhere on Felucca; stick to high-density areas
- Watch for the colored hue and enhanced aggression that signal a rift spawn
- Once a rift spawn is engaged, nearby players should cluster within 16 tiles to secure gate entry

### Inside the Rift

- **All waves must be cleared in order** — you cannot skip to the boss
- Coordinate to avoid splitting players across multiple spawn areas
- The boss will walk back to its spawn point if pulled away
- Recall, Mark, Gate Travel, and Teleport do not work inside; plan your exit in advance
- All standard debuffs and death mechanics apply — loot your own corpse normally
