# Spirit Summoner

The Spirit Summoner is a unique mage build that combines Magery with Spirit Speak to create powerful necromantic summons unavailable to traditional mages. This build offers a completely different summoning experience with enhanced creatures, unique abilities, and tactical options.

## Overview

While standard mages summon creatures through pure magical force, Spirit Summoners tap into necromantic arts to call forth spirits from beyond. By developing Spirit Speak alongside Magery, you gain access to special summons, enhanced traditional summons, and the ability to command Blade Spirits and Energy Vortexes.

This is one of New Dawn's most significant custom systems, fundamentally changing how summoning works for dedicated practitioners.

## What is a Spirit Summoner?

A Spirit Summoner is defined as:

- A character with **50+ Spirit Speak**
- Spirit Speak skill **higher than Magery**
- Access to unique summoning benefits

Once you meet these requirements, you're considered a Spirit Summoner and gain access to all the system's benefits.

## Spirit Speak Benefits

### 5th Circle Summons (Custom Creatures)

When a Spirit Summoner casts 5th circle summoning spells, they summon entirely different creatures:

**Standard Mage:** Summons regular creatures (Earth Elemental, Water Elemental, etc.)

**Spirit Summoner:** Summons special spirit creatures with unique appearances and abilities

These spirit creatures are:

- Visually distinct from normal summons
- More powerful than standard 5th circle summons
- Have unique abilities appropriate to their spirit nature
- Scale with your Spirit Speak skill

### 8th Circle Summons (Enhanced)

Spirit Summoners' 8th circle summons (Air Elemental, Earth Elemental, Fire Elemental, Water Elemental, Daemon) are significantly enhanced:

**Base Stats Increased:**

- All 8th circle summons have greatly increased base stats and skills
- This boost applies before Spirit Speak scaling
- Makes them much stronger than standard mage summons

**Spirit Speak Scaling:**

- Stats and skills further boosted by your Spirit Speak level
- The higher your Spirit Speak, the stronger the summon
- Caps at GM (100) Spirit Speak

**Enhanced Follow Speed:**

- Spirit summons follow significantly faster
- Increased distance before they stop following
- More responsive in combat situations

**Appearance:**

- Spirit summons have a distinct "spirit" hue
- Easily identifiable as spirit-enhanced creatures
- Shows your dedication to the necromantic arts

### Blade Spirits and Energy Vortex

Spirit Speak dramatically changes how BS and EV work:

#### Without Spirit Speak (Standard Mage)

- BS and EV will attack you
- Cannot be controlled
- No special abilities
- Standard summoning time
- Normal stats

#### With Spirit Speak (Spirit Summoner)

Spirit Speak provides escalating benefits:

**At 50+ Spirit Speak:**

- BS and EV ignore you (won't attack their summoner)
- Slight stat increase

**At GM (100) Spirit Speak:**

- **Full command control:** Use "all follow me", "all attack", "all guard me"
- **Poison attacks:** 40% chance to poison targets on hit
- **Significantly increased stats and hit points**
- Visual distinction (spirit hue)
- Don't attack the summoner

**Note on Duration:**

- BS and EV summon duration is NOT affected by Spirit Speak
- They have a set duration regardless of skill level
- Spirit Speak affects their power, not their time

### Spirit Speak and Animal Lore Synergy (Patch 1.0)

Recent updates have made Animal Lore a crucial part of the Spirit Summoner build:

**Animal Lore Benefits:**

- **Directly affects the base strength of your summons** - This is a major boost!
- Works in conjunction with Spirit Speak for multiplicative benefits
- Creates significantly more powerful summons at high levels
- **Essential for maximizing your Spirit Summoner's potential**

**Spirit Speak Focus:**

- Affects summon healing
- Affects dispel resistance  
- Affects summon duration (except BS/EV)

!!! warning "Don't Skip Animal Lore"
    While you can technically be a Spirit Summoner without Animal Lore, you'll be operating at significantly reduced effectiveness. The base strength bonus from Animal Lore is substantial and should be considered a core skill for any serious Spirit Summoner build.

This creates powerful synergy - Spirit Speak affects how your summons perform in combat (healing, dispel resistance, duration), while Animal Lore makes them fundamentally stronger from the moment they're summoned.

## Summon Healing

Spirit Summoners' pets and summons receive healing bonuses:

- Summoned creatures heal faster
- Controlled pets benefit as well
- Scales with Spirit Speak skill
- Does NOT allow summons/pets to self-heal

## Dispel Resistance

Your summons are harder to dispel:

**Player Dispel:**

- 50% base chance to resist at GM Spirit Speak
- Applies to both Dispel and Mass Dispel spells
- When cast by players

**Monster Auto-Dispel:**

- Some monsters (like Dragons) have auto-dispel on melee
- Spirit Speak reduces this chance
- Previously 100% chance, now reduced based on SS skill
- Protection against instant-dispel mechanics

**GM Spirit Speak vs NPC Dispel:**

- 80% chance to resist NPC-cast Dispel/Mass Dispel
- Makes your summons much more durable in PvM

## Building a Spirit Summoner

### Core Skills

- **Magery:** 100 - Essential for casting summon spells
- **Spirit Speak:** 100 - Maximum summoning benefits
- **Evaluating Intelligence:** 100 - Spell damage
- **Meditation:** 100 - Mana regeneration
- **Animal Lore:** 100 - **Highly Recommended** - Significantly boosts summon base strength

!!! tip "Animal Lore is Critical"
    While not technically required, **Animal Lore is extremely important** for Spirit Summoners. It directly affects the base strength of all your summons, making them substantially more powerful. Without it, you're missing a major component of the build's potential.

### Additional Recommended Skills

- **Resisting Spells:** PvP survival and spell defense
- **Wrestling:** Defensive capability and avoiding disruption
- **Inscription:** Spell damage boost

### Stat Distribution

- **Intelligence:** 100+ (primary)
- **Dexterity:** 25-50 (casting speed)
- **Strength:** 25-75 (as needed for equipment/reagents)

## Combat Strategy

### PvM (Player vs Monster)

**Summon Rotation:**

1. Cast 8th circle summon (Daemon preferred)
2. Cast Blade Spirits in front line
3. Cast Energy Vortex for additional DPS
4. Support with direct damage spells
5. Heal summons as needed

**Advantages:**

- Multiple creatures tanking damage
- High total DPS output
- BS/EV poison chance wears down tough enemies
- Dispel resistance keeps summons alive

### PvP (Player vs Player)

**Tactics:**

- EV and BS apply pressure while you cast
- Poison chance disrupts enemy healing
- Command control allows tactical positioning
- Summons can body block escape routes

**Weaknesses:**

- Vulnerable while casting summons
- Can be interrupted during long cast times
- Summons can be avoided by skilled players
- Energy Vortex and Blade Spirits target priority not always ideal

## Comparison: Spirit Summoner vs Standard Mage

| Aspect             | Standard Mage          | Spirit Summoner             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 5th Circle Summons | Regular creatures      | Unique spirit creatures     |
| 8th Circle Summons | Standard stats         | Greatly enhanced stats      |
| BS/EV Control      | None (they attack you) | Full command control at GM  |
| BS/EV Poison       | No                     | 10-40% chance based on SS   |
| Dispel Resistance  | Standard               | 50-80% vs player/NPC dispel |
| Follow Speed       | Standard               | Significantly enhanced      |
| Summon Healing     | Standard               | Enhanced with SS            |
| Build Requirement  | Magery only            | Magery + Spirit Speak       |

## Advanced Tips

### Maximizing Damage

- Keep all summons active (1x 8th, 2x BS, 2x EV if possible)
- Position BS/EV between you and enemy
- Use direct damage spells while summons engage
- Let poison chance stack on tough targets

### Summon Management

- Use "all follow" to regroup summons
- Use "all guard me" for defense
- Use "all attack" to focus fire
- Monitor summon timers (single-click to see remaining time on 8th circle)

### Resource Management

- Spirit Speak doesn't extend BS/EV duration - manage timing
- 8th circle summons last longer - prioritize these
- Carry plenty of reagents for sustained summoning
- Consider Inscription for additional spell power

### PvP Considerations

- Pre-summon before engagement if possible
- BS/EV cast times are shorter - use for quick pressure
- Be ready to recast if dispelled
- Your dispel resistance helps but isn't guaranteed

## Common Mistakes

- **Not taking Animal Lore (biggest mistake!)** - Missing substantial base summon strength
- Not keeping Spirit Speak higher than Magery (loses Spirit Summoner status)
- Forgetting to command BS/EV (they're controllable!)
- Oversummoning without managing reagent costs
- Standing still while casting (easy PvP target)
