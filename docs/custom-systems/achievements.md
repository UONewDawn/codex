# Achievement System

Track your accomplishments and earn rewards through New Dawn's comprehensive Achievement system. Complete challenges, reach milestones, and unlock exclusive titles and items as you explore and master different aspects of the game.

## Overview

The Achievement system was completely rewritten in Patch 1.0 to provide a robust point-based progression system with meaningful rewards. Achievements cover various gameplay aspects including discovery, hunting, crafting, PvP, and more.

Whether you're an explorer, fighter, crafter, or completionist, the achievement system offers long-term goals and tangible rewards for your efforts.

## How It Works

### Point-Based System

Achievements award points based on difficulty:

- **Basic achievements:** 1-5 points (discovery, simple tasks)
- **Standard achievements:** 10 points (skill mastery, single completions)
- **Tiered achievements:** Progressive points (5/10/25/50/100 for I/II/III/IV/V tiers)

Points accumulate per character and track your progress toward various rewards.

### Tracking Progress

Access the achievement system:

- Type `[achievements` (or aliases: `[ach`, `[achievement`, `[achs`) in-game
- View your current progress
- See which achievements you've completed
- Track partially completed achievements with progress bars
- Check your total achievement points

### Character Progress

- Achievement progress is tracked per character
- Each character has their own achievement progression
- Points and completions are character-specific
- Titles earned are added to that character's title collection
