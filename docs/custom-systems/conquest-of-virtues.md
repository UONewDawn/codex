# Conquest of the Virtues

!!! tip
This system is currently not available in-game.

Engage in guild-based territorial warfare across four ruined locations in Britannia. The Conquest of the Virtues system allows guilds to claim and control strategic points, establishing dominance and earning benefits through coordinated warfare.

## Overview

In the aftermath of the Codex War, four significant locations across Britannia lie in ruins. These strategic points have become focal points for guild conflict, where organized groups can establish control and reap the benefits of territorial dominance.

The Conquest of the Virtues is a guild-focused PvP system that rewards coordination, strategy, and sustained presence in key locations.

## The Four Ruins

### Ruins of Britain

**Location:** East of Britain

Once the shining capital of Britannia, Britain fell during the Codex War. Its ruins now serve as a strategic location for guilds seeking to establish dominance in the heartland.

**Features:**

- Central location
- Multiple entry points
- Urban combat environment
- Strategic chokepoints

### Ruins of Trinsic

**Location:** Northwest of Trinsic

The proud city of honor was not spared from the Codex War's devastation. Its ruined streets and shattered walls now host guild conflicts.

**Features:**

- Walled ruins providing defensive positions
- Mix of open and confined spaces
- Multiple levels for tactical advantage

### Ruins of the Shadowlords

**Location:** West of Yew

A dark and foreboding location where the Shadowlords once held power. These ruins carry an ominous atmosphere and challenging terrain.

**Features:**

- Mysterious and atmospheric setting
- Complex layout
- Environmental hazards

### Ruins of Moonglow

**Location:** Original Moonglow island location

Where the magical city of Moonglow once stood, only ruins remain. The lingering magical energy makes this a coveted location.

**Features:**

- Island location
- Magical theme
- Limited access points

## How It Works

### Guild Participation

**Requirements:**

- Must be in a guild to participate
- Guild-based system (individual players represent their guild)
- Unguilded players can enter inactive regions but not claim control

**Region Status:**

- **Inactive:** No guild has control, open to all
- **Active:** A guild has claimed control
- **Contested:** Multiple guilds fighting for control

### Claiming Territory

To claim a ruin:

1. Guild members enter the region
2. Defeat enemies and establish presence
3. Control mechanism activated (specific mechanics TBD)
4. Guild gains control status
5. Benefits begin accumulating

### Defending Territory

Once your guild controls a ruin:

- Other guilds can challenge your control
- Must defend against attackers
- Control can be lost if defenses fail
- Coordination is key to maintaining control

### Benefits of Control

Guilds that control ruins gain benefits (system being expanded):

- Guild progression
- Access to special resources
- Status and recognition
- Potential rewards and currency
- Strategic advantages

## Combat Rules

### PvP Engagement

- Full PvP enabled in active conquest regions

!!! tip "Guild Alliances"
    Form alliances with other guilds to coordinate attacks or defenses. Conquest rewards teamwork and strategy.

## Strategy & Tips

### Offensive Strategy

- **Scout first:** Understand the layout and defender positions
- **Coordinate timing:** Strike when defenders are weakest
- **Multiple entry points:** Don't funnel into one location
- **Sustained pressure:** Conquest isn't won in one battle
- **Communication:** Voice chat or organized Discord

### Defensive Strategy

- **Patrol regularly:** Active presence deters attacks
- **Chokepoint control:** Force attackers into disadvantageous positions
- **Quick response:** Alert guild members when under attack
- **Rotation system:** Keep defenders fresh
- **Supply preparation:** Stock resources and potions

### Guild Organization

- **Dedicated conquest team:** Regular participants
- **Raid leadership:** Experienced strategists
- **Shift coverage:** 24/7 presence if possible
- **Resource pooling:** Guild supplies for defenders
- **Communication channels:** Dedicated Discord channels

## Rewards and Progression

The Conquest system is designed for long-term guild engagement:

- **Territory control** provides ongoing benefits
- **Guild reputation** increases with successful defenses
- **Future expansion** may include conquest-specific rewards
- **Bragging rights** for dominant guilds

!!! note "System Evolution"
    The Conquest of the Virtues system is being actively developed and expanded. Future updates will add more mechanics, rewards, and strategic depth.
