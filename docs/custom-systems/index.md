# Custom Systems

New Dawn builds upon the classic Ultima Online foundation with unique systems that create fresh gameplay experiences while maintaining the spirit of the original game. These custom features distinguish New Dawn from other UO servers and provide new challenges for veterans and newcomers alike.

## Overview

While New Dawn preserves the core UO experience players know and love, it introduces several custom systems designed to enhance gameplay, encourage exploration, and create new opportunities for adventure and progression. These systems have been carefully balanced and refined through dozens of patches based on player feedback.

## Custom Content

### [Codex Rifts](codex-rifts.md)

Hunt colored, buffed rift spawns across Britannia — kill one and a gate may tear open at its corpse. Players within 16 tiles step through into an instanced Felucca battlefield where 4 waves of creatures stand between them and a powerful Rift Master boss.

**Key Features:**

- Rift spawn gate chance: 1%–50% based on creature fame; gate closes after 45 seconds
- 8 rift locations (Yew, Moonglow, Britain, Jhelom, Vesper, Minoc, Trinsic, Skara Brae), 3 active at a time
- Four waves per rift culminating in a unique Rift Master boss
- 60-minute player time limit; Recall, Mark, Gate, and Teleport blocked inside
- Rift Shards from boss (up to 5, scaled by damage) and random mob drops

### [Pirate Adventures](pirate-adventures.md)

Restore deteriorating pirate maps found in Ship's Strongboxes, then activate them to open a gate to one of four instanced pirate encounters. Clear the pirates, defeat the boss, and claim the locked reward chest for gold, magic items, and doubloons.

**Key Features:**

- Four distinct instances: Hideaway, Lighthouse, Treasure Cave, and Tomb
- Unique bosses: Captain Dreadstorm, Ancient Drowner, Captain Grimjaw, Ancient Pirate Mummy
- Maps must be restored with a Bottle of Vinegar (90 Cartography required)
- Locked reward chest with key awarded to the map activator

### [Capture the Flag](capture-the-flag.md)

Engage in classic team-based PvP battles in this 10v10 structured combat system. Coordinate with your team to capture the enemy flag while defending your own in intense 20-minute matches.

**Key Features:**

- 10v10 team battles
- Two unique maps
- Automated scheduling system
- Individual stat tracking
- Point-based scoring system

### [Archaeology System](archaeology.md)

Decode clues dropped by monsters to reveal dig site coordinates, then excavate in three tool stages across active ruins in Britain and Moonglow. Higher skills improve both success rates and your chance of finding something valuable.

**Key Features:**

- Five clue types: map fragments, expedition notes, journal pages, book pages, digging permits
- Decoded using Cartography (map fragments) or Inscription (all others) — requires 70+ skill
- Three-stage excavation: Shovel (Mining 80+) → Pick Hammer (Mining 90+) → Brush (Item ID 80+)
- Find chance scales with Mining, Cartography, Item ID, and hidden clue quality (max 75%)
- Active dig regions: Britain and Moonglow (Minoc, Trinsic, Yew planned)

### [Conquest of the Virtues](conquest-of-virtues.md)

Order and Chaos guilds battle over four ruined locations across Britannia in automated 60-minute ticket-based PvP matches. Control more capture points than the enemy to drain their tickets — first faction to zero loses.

**Key Features:**

- Four ruins, each with 3–5 capture points and independent 4-hour rotation timers
- 400 tickets per faction; deaths and capture point pressure drain tickets
- Physical flags that rise as capture progresses
- Auto-respawn system with full heal and debuff clear
- Live scoreboard with per-player Kill/Death/Capture stats

### [Dungeon Dyes](dungeon-dyes.md)

Kill monsters deep inside Britannia's dungeons to collect rare materials, each unique to its dungeon. Load 250 materials into a Tailor's Dye Kit, add an empty bottle, and craft a permanent clothing dye in that dungeon's signature color.

**Key Features:**

- Nine dungeons, nine unique dyes: Covetous to Ice
- Materials drop from any non-controlled creature killed in the matching dungeon
- 250 materials + 1 empty bottle per dye crafted from the kit's context menu
- Dye applies permanently to clothing in your backpack; bottle is consumed
- Tailor's Dye Kit is blessed and tracks all nine material types independently

### [Spirit Summoner](spirit-summoner.md)

Combine Magery and Spirit Speak to unlock a fundamentally different summoning experience. Spirit Summoners draw from a unique pool of 5th circle spirit creatures, receive dramatically enhanced 8th circle summons, and gain dispel resistance and bonus healing that scale with Spirit Speak — while Animal Lore multiplies the raw power of every summon.

**Key Features:**

- Qualification: Spirit Speak ≥ 50 and Spirit Speak ≥ Magery
- 5th circle spirit creature pool: Polar Bear, Panther, Giant Serpent, Imp, Spiritual Soul, Scorpion, Dire Wolf, Giant Spider

They provide additional content and goals while maintaining compatibility with traditional gameplay styles. Whether you're a PvM enthusiast, PvP fighter, crafter, or explorer, New Dawn's custom systems offer something new to discover.

## Continuous Development
