# Dungeon Dyes

Every dungeon in Britannia leaves its mark on those who spend enough time within its depths. Monsters slain inside a dungeon have a rare chance to drop a **dungeon material** — a unique reagent tied to that dungeon's character. Collect enough of a material, load it into a **Tailor's Dye Kit**, and you can craft a dye bottle that permanently colors clothing in that dungeon's signature hue.

A **Tailoring Guidebook** can be found in the world that documents all nine materials, their origins, and the dyes produced from them.

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Collect Materials

Any non-summoned, non-controlled creature killed **inside a specific dungeon** has a small chance to drop that dungeon's material in its corpse. The material is dungeon-specific: only creatures in Covetous drop Shimmerstones, only creatures in Deceit drop Illusion Shards, and so on.

!!! tip
    Materials are stackable and have a weight of 0.2 stones each.

### Step 2 — Load the Dye Kit

Obtain a **Tailor's Dye Kit** (blessed — it won't drop on death). Double-click the kit and target a stack of dungeon materials to pour them in. The kit tracks each material type independently.

### Step 3 — Craft a Dye Bottle

Single-click the Tailor's Dye Kit to open the crafting menu. Each option corresponds to one dungeon.

**Requirements per bottle:**

- **250 materials** of the chosen type loaded in the kit
- **1 empty bottle** in your backpack

On success, a **Tailor's Dye Bottle** is created and placed in your backpack. The bottle shows the crafting player's name and the hue ID when single-clicked.

### Step 4 — Apply the Dye

Double-click the dye bottle, then target a piece of **clothing in your backpack** (it cannot be worn at the time). The dye is applied and the bottle is consumed. The color is permanent.

!!! warning
    Dye bottles can only be used on clothing (`BaseClothing` items). They cannot be applied to armor, weapons, or other items.

## Item Descriptions

The Tailoring Guidebook describes each material:

**Covetous — Shimmerstone**

> A luminescent gem that radiates with a golden shine, said to be the solidified essence of greed. A tailor can refine this stone into a fine powder to create Aurum Gold Dye.

**Deceit — Illusion Shard**

> A fragment of crystal that distorts light, making the holder's outline appear blurred. Ground into a reflective dust for the crafting of Phantom Gray Dye.

**Despise — Thorn of Envy**

> A thorny vine with a natural, glowing green sap that pulses with a life of its own. The sap can be extracted and concentrated by a tailor to produce Envy Green Dye.

**Destard — Dragon's Blood Opal**

> A rare opal that bears the appearance of being stained with dragon's blood. Crushed into a fine pigment for Dragon's Scale Red Dye.

**Hythloth — Shadow Stone**

> A stone that seems to absorb light, making it appear darker than darkness itself. Its core can be used to infuse cloth with Abyssal Black Dye.

**Shame — Crystal of Regret**

> A purplish crystal that dims and brightens. Pulverized into a dust that creates Forlorn Violet Dye.

**Wrong — Ironweight Ore**

> A heavy, cold iron scale weight that once may have been used for measuring fines or punishments. Melted down and blended with special solutions to yield Judgment Blue Dye.

**Fire — Cinderstone**

> A volcanic rock warm to the touch, containing the fury of a dungeon's inferno. Ground Cinderstone is the primary ingredient for Inferno Orange Dye.

**Ice — Glacial Shards**

> The heart of a glacier — an icy fragment that never melts, perpetually radiating cold. Shavings from the core are perfect for creating Glacial Blue Dye.
