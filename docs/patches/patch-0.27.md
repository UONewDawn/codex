## 🪐 🌌 Codex Rifts 🌌 🪐

In the decades following the Codex War, scholars studied the magical artifacts and lore recovered from the fallen forces. They discovered strange otherworldly creatures, dubbed "rift spawns", that had the ability to tear openings between realms and times.

When rift spawn are defeated, there is a small chance a rift gate will form at the site of its demise. These rift gates shimmer with flowed magic and are a window back in time to Britannia during the early dark days of the Codex War.

Traveling through these "codex rifts", players find themselves embroiled in the raging battles of the past. Survivors from that era see the players as allies sent from the future to help turn the tides of war.

Many adventurers have tempted fate and entered a rift gate, hoping to change the course of history by intervening in events before the Codex's destruction. None are known to have succeeded. The currents of time are not so easily altered.
- Rift spawn have a random chance to spawn anywhere in the world. Mobs with higher fame have a higher chance to be spawned as rift spawn
- When a rift spawn is killed, it has a 1% - 50% chance to spawn a rift gate, based on its fame level
- When a gate spawns, only players who were within 16 tiles of the killed rift spawn may enter regardless if they did any damage or not
