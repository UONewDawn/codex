## 🧵 Tailoring 🪡

- Tailors can now craft special dye, from materials farmed in dungeons.
- To gain this ability, a tailor must join the Tailoring Guild (available at 85.1)
- When they are at 100, if they give the tailoring guildmaster 10,000 gold, they will receieve a tailors dye kit.
- Each dungeon has a specific material, that when crushed down and used with the kit, creates a unique hue for that dungeon
- Each bottle of dye has one use, and any cloth item can be dyed with the bottle
