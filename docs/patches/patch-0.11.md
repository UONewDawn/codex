# SERVER PATCH 0.11

**May 24, 2023**

- GM Item ID can be used on a bag
- Instruments will say exceptional
- Magic reflect buff icon shows
- Fire breath actually does damage!
- Mage AI won't reveal last target if not within 2 tiles (used to be 12)
- Fixed "a Item Name" labels
- Adjusted the bard difficulty formula
- Changed some mobs to the older animations (ie: Balrons)
- Removed Terathan Keep from Harrower
- Added orc scout and Scout AI
- Champs return home if pulled too far
- All dungeons got a slight touch up, still a WIP
- Fixed east facing small brick house sign and door
- Adjusted archery standing still delay to 500ms
- Adjust the amount of fatigue loss on damage to be very low . It's much lower at it's base, and the type of armor material and where it's on your body will add to any additional stam lost penalty (testing this change, can be toggled on/off in game)
