# SERVER PATCH 1.1

Thanks to everyone who logged in and started to etch out a little place in New Dawn! This first patch addresses some go-live bugs that people experienced. No big features or content—right now the focus is just trying to keep things going smooth while I iron out the remaining issues.

❗**This patch contains some very small client patches. Be sure to close out of the client, restart the launcher, and let it update.**❗

## General Fixes & Adjustments 🔧

- Made a slight adjustment to the range check provo uses to determine if range is broken
- You can't talk to the pirate smuggler above ground anymore
- Level 8 scrolls now have a chance to drop on Balrons, Shadow Wyrms, Ancient Wyrms, and a lower chance on dragons
- Fixed the formatting issue with the `[ach` leaderboard tab—you can actually read it now!
- Removed the invisible walls around where Minax, Shadowlords, and True Britannians factions once were
- Fixed the broken clilocs that were preventing bankers from responding to your "bank" request
- The server will send a request to close the resurrection gump before sending a request to give you one
- Per the launch notes, I stated Charter Reward bags would be available during launch week, but the system was cutting that off only 3 days in. Updated the check to reflect the notes, so any account created 2/7 or before that didn't get one should receive it upon login
- The Solo PK achievement won't trigger if you killed yourself
- Fixed issue with potion kegs causing weight issues on your character
- Fixed an issue with Peacemaking not preventing the mob from swinging at you if you got close
- When peace lands, you still see an effect and an emote indicating so. When peace fades, there's also now a message

## Night Sight Improvements 🌙

- Increased the light level of night sight potions; greater night sight potions have a higher light level and last longer
- Fixed a bug when casting night sight on someone else—it would use their magery level instead of the caster's, resulting in a weaker effect
- The night sight spell has a larger duration
- Regular night sight potions have had their light and duration increased to 15-25 min, and greater night sight potions increased to 35-45 min
- You will get some messages above your head when night sight is getting close to fading

## Quality of Life 🏡

- No more puddle fishing 🎣
- Fixed the Minoc moongate so you aren't floating in the air when you arrive
- Increased stat gain chance when you gain a skill (from 1 out of 33 to 1 out of 20)
- Added context menu entry to destroy trash barrels instead of having to use an axe (you can script/macro this)
- Reactive Armor and Magic Reflect now show in the buff bar
- Spellbooks you get when you create a new character will be blessed (any existing spellbooks in the world have also been switched from newbied to blessed)
- Spellbooks will display the blessed label
- Cutting up cloth (robes, etc.) that aren't player-made will now return half the resources needed to craft it
- Kindling weight changed from 5 stones to 0.1 stone per
- Bank checks are now blessed 💰

## Skills & Achievements 🏆

- Added missing skill achievements along with titles that get rewarded when you GM (still need to build a solution retroactively let those who completed those get the achievement)
- If your magery skill is within 10 points of your spirit speak, you will get messages when summoning to inform you that you aren't quite a spirit summoner yet when you cast a summon spell
- You can now craft 3 types of counters

## Creatures & Combat ⚔️

- Fixed issue with banned mobs ignoring that ban
- If you ban a creature, it will go to the ban spot, become non-aggressive, and wander

- Spiritual soul will follow you at normal speed
- On the low chance they give you an artifact clue, it will just be 1 instead of 2
- Adjusted statue drops on Rift Masters
- When champs are killed, it's announced in the Discord channel 📢

## Housing & Player Interaction 🏠

- You can now add someone as a co-owner to your house even if they themselves are homeowners
- `[emote` actions have a delay between uses
- You can't use the stuck menu from the star room to get to T2A (very clever!)

## Economy & Loot 💎

## Rangers Guild Announcement 🏹

*Hear ye! The Scout Division has established outposts across New Dawn!*

These master trackers have pledged their services to aid adventurers who have lost their beloved companions in the wilds. For a modest fee, their elite agents will scour the realm and safely return your lost pets to your side.

**Services Offered:**

- Recovery fee: 3,000 gold per lost companion
- The scouts will not retrieve mounted beasts or those already within close proximity (18 tiles)
- Upon payment, a ranger will dispatch an agent to track your pets
- Your companions will be returned to you within moments
- You are limited to once every 30 minutes

## Ocllo Music Academy 🎵

*The halls of the Ocllo Music Academy now welcome all aspiring bards and musicians!*

The esteemed maestros of Ocllo invite you to hone your craft within their hallowed practice chambers. Those who dedicate themselves to training within the Academy's walls will find their musical talents flourishing more readily under the guidance of the masters.

## Guild Alignment ⚔️

*A new alliance stirs in the realm...*

Guild leaders may now seek audience with the realm's magistrates to forge a pact with the Orcs. Those guilds who swear allegiance to the Orcs will be recognized as allies and orcish warriors and their kin will no longer view you as enemies.

Furthermore, as decreed by the peace treaties signed at the end of the Codex War, the territories surrounding Orcish strongholds have been granted to the clans as sovereign land. Only those guilds bound by the Orcish Pact may establish holdings within these protected borders. All others who attempt to claim these hallowed grounds will find their deeds... null and void.

## New Dawn Portal 🌐

The New Dawn portal has also been updated with additional information. Along with seeing guilds, you can now search and find your achievements and view the achievement leaderboards.
