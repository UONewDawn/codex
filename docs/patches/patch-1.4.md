# SERVER PATCH 1.14

## February 22nd, 2026

This patch continues to address bugs and behaviors reported by the community.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes & Adjustments

- Completely removed hats from the loot pool on drops. If you want a hat, make or buy one from your local tailor
- Fixed issue with [0] showing on non-hued items
- Armor is no longer newbied when you create a character; any newbied armor in game is changed to normal
- You can now tame a regular horse regardless of your taming skill level
- Casting blade spirits or energy vortex into a house, when you're not in a house, is no longer allowed
- Paralyzing blow duration increased to 4 seconds
- Mobs will no longer start attacking each other after they can't attack you for a while
- Spirit Summoners can no longer use circle 8 summon scrolls. This is to balance out how mobile summoners can be compared to tamers, and their ability to cast 8th-circle spells with a low chance of a fizzle
- Balrons should now display correctly in-game
- Arrows that miss and land on the ground will auto-stack
- Fixed the issue with the deteriorating pirate map; it must now be cleaned first (cleaning liquid can be found on certain pirates and can also drop in brigand camps)
- Your tillerman will let you know your boat has been refreshed if it hasn't been refreshed in over 15 minutes
- Disabled telekinesis on house doors until I add the ability to lock interior doors in public houses
- Fixed the distance calculation for the gold reward on escorts
- New Minoc now has a tailor shop north of the bank
- The New Minoc moongate is now a guarded zone

## 🌀 Codex Rifts

Codex Rifts have seen a slight overhaul with the goal of making the fights feel a bit more challenging and scaling up in difficulty as you go through the tiers of mobs. The loot pools have also been adjusted on the tier level mobs.

Rift Masters are a bit more difficult now, with special abilities. Also, all Rift Masters have had their HP pools increased, and can also drop up to 5 to 8 shards, depending on the rift master. They also now have a small circle of gold that drops, similar to champs.

## 📜 Bulk Order Deeds

- BODs now require a minimum skill of 70.1 to have a chance to get one
- You must have 85.1 or higher for a chance to get a large BOD
- The tailoring and blacksmith BOD 6-hour time limit applies to your whole account now instead of each character

---

## 🏠 Housing

- Houses with a courtyard now have an option in the house menu to clear all the courtyards of marked runes.
- This service costs 500k gold, _regardless_ of whether it finds any. It will also wipe the ones you have. Sometimes 500k is worth a peaceful mind
- Fixed the doors on the large keep with rear courtyard (new placements only, if you need yours fixed, let me know in game)
- Fixed the house region on the Two-Story Courtyard house

---

## 🟢 Orcs

- Added a `[guildskin` command for guilds aligned with Orcs, Undead, etc. that will let you shave your hair and beard, and change your skin color to match your alignment (Orcs, for example, have some green, brown, red, and gray skin to pick)
- Bola and Bola balls can be crafted, but can only be used by Orc-aligned guilds
- Orc-aligned guilds cannot use mounts
- After you're knocked off your horse, you can't get back on for 3 seconds
- Bolas have a 30-second cooldown
