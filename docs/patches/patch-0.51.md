## 🏹Archery🎯

To help make archers more viable, the shooting delay was reduced to 500ms several patches ago. However, they remained underpowered due to lack of a special ability. Archers now have the snare ability.

- Requires at least 80 anatomy and 80 archery
- Double-click your equipped bow to toggle snare
- 25% chance to ensnare at 100 anatomy and 100 archery
- Each attempt (failed or successful) uses 15 stamina when active

After a successful snare:

- The snared target cannot move (but can still attack and cast spells) for 3 seconds
- The snared target will have any spell they were casting disrupted
- The archer cannot snare another target for 20 seconds

## 🏰The Trinsic Terathan Outpost🕷️

When the Avatar destroyed the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom, the magical backlash created spatial anomalies throughout Britannia. One significant manifestation was the appearance of a Terathan fortress near Trinsic.

This structure is believed to be a duplicate of the legendary Terathan Keep from beyond the serpent pillars. When the Codex was destroyed, its vast knowledge took physical form in areas where magical energies were strongest.

The Terathans were immediately drawn to this anomaly and claimed it as their own. The fortress appeared during the final days of the Codex War when Trinsic's defenses were focused on the gargoyle threat.

Today, the Trinsic Terathan Outpost remains one of the region's greatest dangers.
