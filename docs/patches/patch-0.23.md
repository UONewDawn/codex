# SERVER PATCH 0.23

**August 16, 2023**

- Adjustments to the purple pirate map boss, to make them a bit more difficult (still needs some additional tweaks)
- Updated the town of Trinsic to make it more lived in. Fixed Trinsic region issues.
- Enabled "smooth sailing" -- be sure to enable it ClassicUO (Options->General->Smooth boat movements)
- Fixed issue with boat commands not resetting to the right command
- Pirate Cannoneer has LOS checks now
- Removed unused quest items (unicorn ribs, etc
- Can't use ethy in a pirate map instance
- Removed 7 second delay on runebooks & runebooks now have a max of 10 charges
- Adjusted how Tracking works:
-- At GM, you can track up to 100 tiles away, 50 tiles within a dungeon.
-- The mobile being tracked must be in the same region and dungeon level as you
-- Your base chance is calculated by using the total tracking and detect hidden vs total hiding and stealth of mobiles in your range.
-- When tracking a player, after the base chance is calculated, the chance is then also reduced based on the distance. So you have a lesser chance to detect someone 90 tiles away, compared to 20 tiles away.
- When you die, items that stay in your pack (ie: blessed items) will retain the position
- Fixed the label on single-click ethys
- Champ leash was increased from 24 tiles to 90.
- Fixed issue with secure items using 125 lockdowns
- Locked down containers can now be access by anyone in range
- Weapons will display if they are currently poisoned on single-click
