# SERVER PATCH 0.22

**August 7, 2023**

- Activate meditation is faster compared to passive
- Explosion potions have a small random delay before they explode (min/max adjustable ingame for testing)
- Some spells weren't reducing the damage correctly when a player successfully resisted the spell.
- Some spells allowed for 12 tile range instead of 10
