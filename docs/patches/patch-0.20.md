# SERVER PATCH 0.20

**August 2, 2023**

- Implemented baseline barding difficulty. Previously, the difficulty was calculated by a variety of factors that made it a bit more difficult to fine tune mobs.
- Increased the base barding difficulty on all pirates. I suspect this might still need some adjustment.
- Fixed issue with cooldown on potion use timers
- Every player kill is now tracked and saved to a database for later website extraction
- Buff and debuff spells can now counter potions, and potions can now counter buff and debuff spells
- Added a slight delay to firebombs
- Blocked housing in parts of ruined towns
- Fixed east facing signs on public houses and fixed east facing brick door and sign
