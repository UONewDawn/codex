# SERVER PATCH 0.30

**November 11, 2023**

This patch includes a very small and minor client patch. Please restart the launcher to download.

- EVs and BS no longer can be controlled or enhanced by spirit speak (revert from previous patch), however they still won't attack you if you're a spirit summoner
- Changed the base dark gray system font hue to a brighter hue
- Fixed issue with achievements and other customizations not saving correctly

🗺️ Added Moonglow, Trinsic, Serpent's Hold, Skara Brae, and Paws as starting towns

🗺️ Moved Dawn (Event Center) from Trammel to Felucca

- Added additional checks in Dawn to prevent harmful actions (spells, corpse looting, etc.)
- Changed the hue on spirit summons (on the fence with it)
- Removed horse stamina loss

🏴‍☠️Pirate cannons won't shoot the dead

🏴‍☠️You cannot open another pirate map within a pirate map instance

🏴‍☠️If a pirate map instance is abandoned (player count hits 0), the instance will reset in 15 seconds, instead of 5 minutes if you complete or fail

🥷If you use stealth and are over 80 and have 100 hiding, it will hide you and allow you to start moving. All hiding and stealth checks apply

🥷If you have over 80 stealth, you can enable auto-stealth, which will re-stealth you if you exceed your max steps outside the 10 second delay window

🥷The auto-stealth option can be enabled/disabled via single-click on your character

🥷A system message will tell you how many stealth steps you have left

🥷Added button to disguise kit to move disguise before 2 hour timer expires
