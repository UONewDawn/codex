# SERVER PATCH 0.12

**May 27, 2023**

- Fixed issue with placing boats
- Adjusted follower speed. If bonded, they match your speed, if not, they are slightly slower.
- Removed dex penalty for armor (stam penalty fatigue is enabled, based on armor material)
- Adjusted the hues on studded, barbed, spined leather
- FIxed wrong healing message
- Ocllo dungeon skill limit raised to 80
- Followers return to you after killing target instead of just wandering around
- Damage on monsters is in line with damage on players (on the high end, still researching the low 1 min damage)
