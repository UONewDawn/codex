# SERVER PATCH 0.41

**May 1, 2024**

This is a quick server patch to address a few small issues from the previous patch and make a small adjustment to poisoning

- Fixed logic on the pirate region to not eject NPCs
- Fixed issue with new Discord registration attempts not sending you a message on Discord
- When you attempt to cast poison on a mob, it will now consider your poison skill. At GM poisoning, you have a 50% chance to apply poison even if they're immune. It scales down from 50% (ie: at 55 poisoning, you have a 27.5% chance) (still testing the numbers)
