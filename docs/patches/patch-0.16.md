# SERVER PATCH 0.16

**June 24, 2023**

- Adjusted summoning followers count based on if you have Spirit Speak or not
- Additional changes to how armor rating is calculated to be more in like with the weapons damage
- Adjust base damage formula and when damage is cut in half to match archived formula
- Reverted weapons (speed, damage) back to the UOR era numbers. I moved them to T2A numbers, but they were just too low.

🔥 Spirit Speak will now summon all new special creatures for 5th circle. Without Spirit Speak, it's the regular mage summons.

🔥 Spirit Speak will summon boosted 8th level summons. Single-click to see remaining summoned time.

- Added Champion tokens and Harrower shards (in-game currency). This will be expanded to be use in a reward store.

🔥 Added the pirate instance system (WIP - Red is available with spawners to test). A pirate ship has pulled into Dawn's harbor 🏴‍☠️

- Fixed issue with Discord registration. To register, start typing /register on Discord to test.
- Initial implementation of the title system
- Implemented the achievement system. Access via [profile or [achievements. Will be expanded out over time.
