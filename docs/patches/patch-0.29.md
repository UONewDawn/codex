**November 8, 2023**

- Fixed items (regs, pots, etc) being consumed when playing CTF
- Removed the stamina loss mechanic when running 🏃‍♂️
- Upon a successful stun, casting is disrupted 👊
- You cannot get on a mount that was in combat recently 🏇
- Reds can only use the chaos shrine to resurrect
- Removed guard region in Bucs Den Inn

🌌 Fixed Codex Rift timer gump

🌌 Fixed small issue with player tracking in the Codex Rift instance

🌌 Only allow one account in the Codex Rift instance

- Adjusted EV cast time to be lower ⏱️
- Blade Spirits and Energy Vortex summons are now effected by your Spirit Speak skill
- BS and EV summon times are not effected by Spirit Speak (unlike the other summons that give you a longer summon time)
- BS and EV will now attack the caster, unless they caster is considered a spirit summoner (SS is over 50 and higher than magery) then they will ignore you
- BS and EV have a base 10% chance to poison when they hit you. This scales up with spirit speak, maxing at a 40% chance at GM
- BS and EV that are summoned when you have GM spirit speak can be controlled via commands (ie: all follow, all attack)
- Summoned creatures that are controlled by a spirit summoner will have a different hue
