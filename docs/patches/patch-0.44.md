# SERVER PATCH 0.44

**March 25, 2025**

## 🪴Gardening/Plants🧑‍🌾

Animals (such as bears) that eat things that have seeds in their diet have a chance to drop seeds. As such, animals that spend time in dirt (such as boars) have a chance to drop fertile dirt.

## 📜General Fixes/Changes📜

- Marble Island is blocked (for now) from housing
- Removed the Old Trinsic area from CTF so it can be used for future events
- Developed the base seasonal event code for seasonal event automation
- Houses can no longer be placed within 5 tiles of another house. The 1 tile border of no blocking items still applies. With 1 house per account, the goal here is to not have every inch of open land covered with houses, and remove single chokepoints between houses
- Fixed the cost and stock of mandrake root on mage vendors
- Summoned or controls pets no longer heal themselves
- Dragons (and other mobs with abilities) will actually use them (ie: fire breath)
- Removed broadcast and receiver crystals from vendors
- Fixed crashes due to disabled achievement system
- Changed the buttons on the moongate gump to easier to read for the old people
- Fixed issue with the criminal buff causing the client to have an issue

## 🗺️Map🗺️

- Several areas, randomly sized or located throughout the world, have had all their trees cleared and land leveled to support additional housing
- A bunch of small tweaks no one will notice
- The King's Men Theater has reopened thanks to support from the First Academy of Music
