## 🌊 Vesper Rises 🎣

On the shores where the island city of Vesper once stood now rises a modest fishing town, rebuilt over generations by those who remembered the fallen city.

The first to return were bold explorers, venturing into the perilous sunken passageways in search of artifacts and knowledge. They found only ominous remnants of lives tragically bound to the city's watery grave.

It was their stories that called others back, descendants of those who fled Vesper's end. They returned over decades to the shores of their ancestors, building new lives atop the wreckage. Wooden piers and decks now rise where tragedy struck generations before.

The fishing town battles the frigid climate, a bittersweet revival still haunted by its past. Though new life blooms on the surface, the hallowed halls below remain undisturbed. There secrets and spirits keep vigil, leaving Vesper's full fate still known only to the sea.

## 🗻 Cove - Orc Stronghold ⛰️

Cove once found tranquil shelter in the mountain's embrace, but that peace was shattered when orcs tunneled forth from below. Cove's history as a revered haven of healing arts faded into memory.

Now Cove's mighty wall encircles orc warrens instead of archives. Etched prayers on mountain passes are all that remain of Cove's people, lamenting the sanctuary's fate. Orc banners whip atop the battlements that once protected Cove but now fortify its conquerors. Few dare approach the stronghold where orc patrols roam, erasing Cove's noble past. Only cold, pitiless stone bears witness to the fallen sanctuary's fate.
