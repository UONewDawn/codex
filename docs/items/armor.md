# Armor

Protect yourself with various armor types in New Dawn.

!!! info "Pre-Age of Shadows System"
    New Dawn uses a traditional Pre-AoS armor system. Armor provides straightforward physical protection (AR) without modern properties like elemental resistances, skill bonuses, or luck. Focus on armor rating, weight, and whether it allows meditation.

## Armor Types

We use the standard armor types found in UO.

!!! warning
    These need refinement. Confirm in the Discord community.
