## Spirit Speak System

New Dawn features a completely custom Spirit Speak system that fundamentally changes summoning mechanics.

### What is a Spirit Summoner?

A character becomes a Spirit Summoner when:

- **Spirit Speak is 50+**
- **Spirit Speak is higher than Magery**

Once these conditions are met, you gain access to all Spirit Speak benefits.

### Custom 5th Circle Summons

Standard mages summon regular creatures. Spirit Summoners summon **custom spirit creatures**:

- Visually distinct from normal summons
- More powerful than standard 5th circle summons
- Unique abilities appropriate to spirit nature
- Scale with Spirit Speak skill
- Different creature types than normal summons

**Regular Mage:** Summons Earth/Water Elementals, etc.  
**Spirit Summoner:** Summons unique spirit creatures

### Enhanced 8th Circle Summons

Spirit Summoners' 8th circle summons (Daemon, Elementals) are dramatically enhanced:

**Base Stats Increased:**

- All 8th circle summons have significantly higher base stats
- This boost applies BEFORE Spirit Speak scaling
- Much stronger than standard mage summons

**Spirit Speak Scaling:**

- Stats and skills further boosted by Spirit Speak level
- Maximum boost at GM (100) Spirit Speak
- The higher your SS, the stronger the summon

**Enhanced Behavior:**

- **Faster follow speed** - more responsive
- **Increased follow distance** - stay with you better
- **Spirit hue** - visually distinct appearance
- **Longer duration** (affected by Spirit Speak)

**Single-Click Display:**

- Shows remaining summoned time
- Easy to track summon duration

### Blade Spirits & Energy Vortex

Spirit Speak transforms BS and EV mechanics:

#### Without Spirit Speak (Standard Mage)

- BS/EV will attack their summoner
- Cannot be controlled
- No special abilities
- Standard stats

#### With Spirit Speak (Spirit Summoner)

**At 50+ Spirit Speak:**

- BS/EV ignore you (won't attack summoner)
- Slight stat increase

**At GM (100) Spirit Speak:**

- **Full command control:** "all follow me", "all attack", "all guard me"
- **Poison attacks:** 40% chance to poison on hit
- **Significantly boosted stats** and hit points
- **Spirit hue** appearance
- **Duration:** NOT affected by Spirit Speak (set duration)

### Spirit Speak & Animal Lore Synergy (Patch 1.0)

**Animal Lore Benefits:**

- Affects the **base strength** of your summons
- Works in conjunction with Spirit Speak
- Creates even more powerful summons at high levels

**Spirit Speak Focus:**

- Affects **summon healing**
- Affects **dispel resistance**
- Affects **summon duration** (except BS/EV)

**Build Options:**

- Focus heavily on Spirit Speak
- Include Animal Lore for synergy
- Balance both for maximum effect

### Dispel Resistance

Your summons are significantly harder to dispel:

**Player Dispel/Mass Dispel:**

- **50% chance to resist** at GM Spirit Speak
- Protects against enemy mages
- Makes summons more durable in PvP

**NPC Cast Dispel/Mass Dispel:**

- **80% chance to resist** at GM Spirit Speak
- Protects against enemy spellcasters in PvM

**Monster Auto-Dispel:**

- Some monsters (Dragons) have auto-dispel on melee
- Was 100% chance to dispel
- Spirit Speak reduces this chance based on skill
- Protects against instant-dispel mechanics

### Summon Healing

Spirit Speak enhances healing for your summons:

- Summons heal faster
- Controlled pets benefit
- Scales with Spirit Speak skill
- Does NOT allow summons to self-heal

**Note:** Pets and summons do NOT self-heal (Patch 0.45).

### Casting Time Reductions

Summon spells have reduced casting times:

- 5th circle summons cast faster
- 8th circle summons cast faster
- Makes the Spirit Summoner more responsive
- Still requires mana and reagents

### Spirit Summoner Strategy

**PvM (Player vs Monster):**

1. Cast 8th circle summon (Daemon preferred)
2. Cast Blade Spirits in front line
3. Cast Energy Vortex for additional DPS
4. Support with direct damage spells
5. Use command control to position summons

**PvP (Player vs Player):**

- Pre-summon before engagement
- BS/EV apply pressure while you cast
- Poison chance disrupts enemy healing
- Use "all attack" for focus fire
- Body blocking with controlled summons

**Key Advantages:**

- Multiple powerful creatures
- High total DPS
- Dispel resistance keeps summons alive
- Command control adds tactical options
- Poison chance wears down tough enemies

### Other Spirit Speak Benefits

**GM Spirit Speak:**

- Can see ghosts
- Useful for communication with dead players
- RP and practical applications

**Summoner Status:**

- Must maintain Spirit Speak > Magery
- Dropping below loses Spirit Summoner status
- Regain by raising Spirit Speak above Magery again
