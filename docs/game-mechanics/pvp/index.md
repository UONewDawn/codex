# PvP & Murder

Player versus Player combat is a core component of New Dawn's Felucca-only environment. Whether you're a red hunting victims, a blue defending yourself, or somewhere in between, understanding PvP mechanics and consequences is essential.

## Welcome to Felucca

New Dawn features a single PvP-enabled facet:

- Full PvP enabled everywhere (except safe zones like Dawn)
- Consensual and non-consensual combat
- Risk vs reward gameplay
- Meaningful consequences for criminal activity
- Active PvP community

## Core PvP Mechanics

### Combat System

New Dawn's combat includes numerous custom modifications:

- No dexterity penalty (replaced with stamina loss system)
- Custom weapon and armor values (UOR era)
- Modified spell damage for PvP balance
- Explosion potion mechanics
- Archery snare ability
- Parrying shield bash

For complete combat details, see the [Combat System](../combat.md) page.

### Flagging System

**Blue (Innocent):**

- Not engaged in criminal activity
- Protected by town guards
- Can be attacked but attacker becomes criminal

**Gray (Criminal):**

- Committed criminal act
- 2-minute timer (shown as debuff)
- Anyone can attack freely
- Guards will kill on sight in towns

**Red (Murderer):**

- Has murder counts
- Permanent status until counts decay or pardoned
- Restricted resurrection options
- Dungeon penalties apply

**Orange (Guild War):**

- Enemy guild member during war
- Attackable without consequence
- Clean PvP between guilds

## Murder System

The murder system creates meaningful consequences for player killing:

### Key Features

- Short-term and long-term murder counts
- Short-term decay: 16h (under 5 murders) / 24h (5+ murders) of logged play time
- Long-term decay: 48h (under 5 kills); 5+ long-term kills require a Forged Pardon to clear
- Stat/skill loss on resurrection scales with murders: 15%–25%
- Dungeon re-entry lockout (5 min) on death with 5+ murders
- Forged pardon system (up to 3 per character, increasing cost)
- Decay only accumulates while logged in

For complete details, see the [Murder System](murder-system.md) page.
