# Meditation

Regenerate mana faster through active meditation.

## Overview

Meditation allows mages to actively regenerate mana at an accelerated rate. This essential skill keeps you casting spells without long waiting periods between fights.

## Effects

### Mana Regeneration

- **Active Regen** - Regenerate mana while meditating
- **Faster Recovery** - Much faster than passive regen
- **Sustained Casting** - Cast more spells in sequence
- **Essential for Mages** - Core skill for any caster

### Regen Rate

Mana regeneration speed depends on:

- Meditation skill level
- Intelligence stat
- Equipment bonuses
- Focus skill (if applicable)

## Requirements

### To Meditate Successfully

- Must be stationary (not moving)
- Cannot be actively casting
- **Cannot wear metal armor** (critical restriction)

### Armor Restrictions

!!! warning
    These need refinement. Confirm your template in the Discord community.

- ✅ Leather armor - Meditation works
- ✅ Studded leather - Meditation works
- ❌ Ringmail - Blocks meditation
- ❌ Chainmail - Blocks meditation
- ❌ Plate armor - Blocks meditation

!!! warning "Metal Armor"
    Wearing metal armor prevents meditation! Mages must use leather or special "mage armor" property items.

## Training

### Active Meditation

Use the meditation skill when mana is below maximum:

- Cast spells to drain mana
- Use meditation skill
- Wait for mana to regenerate
- Repeat process

### Training Method

**Fastest Training:**

1. Cast expensive spells (Energy Vortex, Flamestrike)
2. Use Meditation skill
3. Wait for mana to regenerate
4. Cast spells again
5. Repeat until 100

**Passive Training:**

- Gains naturally while hunting
- Meditate between combats
- Automatic improvement over time

!!! tip "Efficient Training"
    Create a macro: Cast spell → Meditate → Wait → Repeat. This trains both Magery and Meditation simultaneously!
