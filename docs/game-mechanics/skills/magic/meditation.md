# Meditation

## Overview

Meditation helps regenerate mana. You can either regen passively, every time your mana is below your INT, or actively, by using the skill, you will enter a "trance" that will be broken if you speak or make any other action. Active regen is faster than passive.

## Armor

The type of armor you wear will impact how fast you can regen. Try to avoid any metal based armor.

## Training

Train from Mage NPCs to reach around 30.

In order to gain skill points you need to regenerate mana, you can consume mana by either casting spells or by equipping and un-quipping a magical wizard hat. You can gain points with passive regen or you can try to use Meditation when your are not at full mana.

When training Magery you will also naturally gain Meditation too.
