# Spirit Speak

## Overview

Spirit Speak passively enhances your Magery summons, making them last longer and harder to dispel.

Once you reach 100 and become a Grand Master, you will be able to see and communicate with ghosts.

Whe combined with Animal Lore, your summons will also be stronger.

## Training

Train from Healer NPCs to reach around 30.

Spirit speak can be used on a 10 seconds cooldown, it doesn't have difficulty checks. Just use it until you reach 100.
