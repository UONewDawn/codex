# Spirit Speak

Spiritual communication, and spirit summoning.

## Overview

Spirit Speak is essential for the **Spirit Summoner** build, where it enhances summoned creatures' duration, dispel resistance, and healing effectiveness.

## Effects

### Mana Regeneration

- **Works While Moving** - No need to stand still
- **Any Armor** - Functions in plate armor

### Spiritual Communication

- Talk to ghosts and spirits
- Communicate with the dead
- Lore and roleplay value

### Spirit Summoner Bonuses

When used with the **Spirit Summoner** system:

- **Summon Duration** - Higher Spirit Speak increases how long summons last
- **Dispel Resistance** - Harder for enemies to dispel your spirit summons
- **Healing Bonus** - Active Spirit Speak boosts healing on spirit summons
- **Synergy with Animal Lore** - Summon strength scales with [Animal Lore](../taming-and-animals/animal-lore.md)

!!! info "Spirit Summoner Scaling"
    The power of your spirit summons (stats, skills, armor) scales based on **[Animal Lore](../taming-and-animals/animal-lore.md)** skill, while **Spirit Speak** determines duration, dispel resistance, and healing effectiveness when active.

## How It Works

### Activation

1. Use Spirit Speak skill
2. Success grants mana regeneration over time
3. Effect lasts for a duration
4. Can reactivate after cooldown

### Regeneration Details

- Mana restored over 10-15 seconds
- Amount based on skill level
- Can be used in combat
- Works with any armor

## Training

- Can be used anywhere
- Lower success rate
- Slower skill gains
- Still functions for mana
