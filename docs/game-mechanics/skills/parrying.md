# Parrying

Shield-based defense and damage reduction.

## Overview

Parrying allows you to block incoming attacks with a shield. This defensive skill significantly reduces damage taken and is essential for tank builds.

## Effects

### Active Defense
- **Block Attacks** - Chance to completely block incoming hits
- **Reduce Damage** - Even partial blocks reduce damage
- **Stagger Enemies** - Blocked attacks can interrupt opponents

### Requirements
- Shield equipped
- Combat skill (weapon skill or wrestling)
- Active engagement in combat

## Training

### Combat Training
Parrying improves by taking hits:
- Equip a shield
- Engage in combat
- Get hit by enemies
- Higher skill enemies = better gains

### Training Methods

**Early (0-40):**
- Fight weak monsters while blocking
- Training arena sparring
- Safe controlled environment

**Intermediate (40-70):**
- Hunt mid-level monsters
- Take more hits intentionally
- Group hunting (let them hit you)

**Advanced (70-100):**
- Fight strong monsters
- Champion spawns
- PvP practice

!!! warning "Training Caution"
    You must be hit to train Parrying. Bring healing supplies and don't train on enemies that hit too hard!
