# Resisting Spells

Defense against hostile magic and spell effects.

## Overview

Resisting Spells is the primary defense against magical attacks. This essential skill reduces spell damage, prevents debuffs, and shortens the duration of negative effects.

## Effects

### Magic Defense

- **Resist Hostile Spells** - Chance to completely resist
- **Reduce Spell Damage** - Lower damage from offensive magic
- **Shorter Debuffs** - Reduced duration of curses and effects
- **Poison Resistance** - Better chance to resist poison spells

### What It Protects Against

- Direct damage spells (fireball, lightning, etc.)
- Paralyze and freeze effects
- Poison spells
- Stat debuffs (curse, weaken, clumsy)
- Mind control effects

## Training

!!! warning
    These need refinement. Confirm your template in the Discord community.

### Getting Hit by Spells

The only way to train is being targeted by hostile magic:

**Early (0-40):**

- Have a friend cast spells on you
- Fight casting monsters
- Low-level enemy mages

**Intermediate (40-70):**

- Fight stronger casters
- Dungeon mage monsters
- More powerful spells = better gains

**Advanced (70-100):**

- High-level caster monsters
- Liches, elder gazers, demons
- PvP against mages

!!! tip "Training with Friends"
    The fastest way: Have a mage friend repeatedly cast Lightning or Fireball at you while you heal. Bring lots of bandages or healing potions!
