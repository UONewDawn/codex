# Healing

Use bandages to heal yourself and others.

## Overview

Healing allows you to restore hit points using bandages. This essential survival skill is crucial for all combat builds and provides self-sufficiency in dangerous situations.

## Effects

### Basic Healing
- **Heal Hit Points** - Restore HP over time
- **Cure Poison** - Remove poison (requires [Anatomy](anatomy.md))
- **Resurrect** - Revive dead players (requires high Anatomy)

### Healing Calculation
HP restored depends on:
- Healing skill level
- Anatomy skill level
- Dexterity stat
- Bandage quality

## Training

### Early Training (0-30)
- Bandage yourself when damaged
- Practice in safe areas
- Get hit by weak monsters, heal up

### Intermediate (30-50)
- Heal during light combat
- Practice timing between attacks
- Heal other players

### Advanced (50-80)
- Heal during serious combat
- Perfect timing and positioning
- Emergency healing practice

### Master Level (80-100)
- Heal in intense combat
- Resurrect fallen allies
- Cure deadly poisons

    Find a friend or summon to hit you, then heal repeatedly. Fast and controlled training method!

**Magic Healing:**
- ✅ Instant or faster
- ✅ More HP restored
- ❌ Costs mana
- ❌ Blocked by magic immunity
