# Parrying

Shield-based defense and damage reduction.

## Overview

Parrying allows you to block incoming attacks with a shield. This defensive skill significantly reduces damage taken and is essential for tank builds.

## Effects

### Active Defense

- **Block Attacks** - Chance to completely block incoming hits
- **Reduce Damage** - Even partial blocks reduce damage
- **Stagger Enemies** - Blocked attacks can interrupt opponents

### Requirements

- Shield equipped
- Combat skill (weapon skill or wrestling)
- Active engagement in combat

## Training

!!! warning
    These need refinement. Confirm your template in the Discord community.

### Combat Training

Parrying improves by taking hits:

- Equip a shield
- Engage in combat
- Get hit by enemies
- Higher skill enemies = better gains

### Training Methods

- Training arena sparring
- Safe controlled environment

**Intermediate (40-70):**

**Advanced (70-100):**

- Champion spawns
- PvP practice

!!! warning "Training Caution"
    You must be hit to train Parrying. Bring healing supplies and don't train on enemies that hit too hard!
