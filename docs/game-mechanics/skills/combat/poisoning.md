# Poisoning

## Overview

Poisoning allows you to apply various levels of poison to weapons or enhance the potency of poison spells.

It's often paired with Fencing, since all weapons used with that skill are fast and benefit from quick, repeated strikes.

## How to apply

Use the Poisoning skill, target the poison potion and then target the desired weapon.

Be aware that failing to apply poison to a weapon has a chance to poison the user instead.

## Chance of poisoning

The chance to poison a target on each successful hit is calculated by dividing the Poisoning skill by 4.

A weapon poisoned by someone with 100 Poisoning has a 25% chance to apply poison on each successful hit.

## Uses

This table shows how many successful hits your weapon has before the poison wears off.

Every hits consumes one use, no matter if the poison is applied or not.

| Poison level   | Uses |
|----------------|------|
| Lesser Poison  | 18   |
| Poison         | 16   |
| Greater Poison | 14   |
| Deadly Poison  | 12   |

## Training

Poisoning can be trained from Thief NPCs.

| Skill    | Apply poison    |
|----------|-----------------|
| 0 - 30   | Train from NPCs |
| 30 - 60  | Poison          |
| 60 - 97  | Greater poison  |
