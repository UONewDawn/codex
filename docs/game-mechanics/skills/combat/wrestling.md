# Wrestling

## Overview

Wrestling lowers the chances of being physically hit, is most used by mages as a defensive skill to avoid the disruption of spells.

It's also used to calculate the chance of hitting with your bare hands.

## Stun Punch

Combining at least 80 Wrestling with 80 Anatomy allows you to use the Stun Punch special ability.

On a successful hit the target will be paralyzed for 5 seconds.

## Disarm

Combining at least 80 Wrestling with 80 Arms Lore allows you to use the Disarm special ability.

On a successful hit, the target weapon or spellbook will be removed from their hands and placed in their backpack.

## Training

Train from Mage NPCs to reach around 30.

To be more efficient have two characters fight using Healing and Anatomy on each other, this way you can train Healing, Anatomy and Tactics at the same time.

Have the target equip high amor rating and a weapon they have 0 skill with, hit them until you reach 81, then switch the target weapon with one they are GM with and continue until 100.
