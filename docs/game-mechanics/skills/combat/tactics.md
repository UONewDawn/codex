# Tactics

## Overview

Tactics determines how much of your weapon base damage goes through on a successful hit.

## Damage calculation

If a weapon has a base damage of 40, and you have 80 Tactics, you will deal 52 damage.

| Tactics | % of Base Damage Dealt |
|---------|------------------------|
| 10      | 60%                    |
| 20      | 70%                    |
| 30      | 80%                    |
| 40      | 90%                    |
| 50      | 100%                   |
| 60      | 110%                   |
| 70      | 120%                   |
| 80      | 130%                   |
| 90      | 140%                   |
| 100     | 150%                   |

To calculate, multiple your weapon base damage by the % converted into decimals (60% is 0.60 and 150% is 1.50).

## Training

Train from Weaponsmith NPCs to reach around 30.

To be more efficient have two characters fight using Healing and Anatomy on each other, this way you can train Healing, Anatomy and Tactics at the same time. Have the target equip high amor rating and a weapon they have 0 skill with, hit them until you reach 81, then switch the target weapon with one they are GM with and continue until 100.
