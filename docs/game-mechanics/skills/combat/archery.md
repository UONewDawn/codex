# Archery

## Overview

Archery allows you to fight from a distance using bows and crossbows, this skill excels at kiting enemies and provides a significant safety advantage.

To help make Archers more viable, the shooting delay was reduced to 500ms and the Snare ability was added.

<!-- Not clear if all weapons have the same delay between shots -->

## Weapons and ammo

This table doesn't take into account the Strength, Dexterity and Tactics of the attacker or the Armor Rating of the defender.

Weapons are considered being at full durability.

## Snare

The new snare ability lets you immobilize a target for 3 seconds, but it can still attack or cast spells.

- Requires at least 80 Archery and 80 Anatomy
- Double-click your equipped bow to toggle snare
- 25% chance to ensnare at 100 Archery and 100 Anatomy
- Each attempt (failed or successful) uses 15 stamina when active

After a successful snare:

- The snared target cannot move (but can still attack and cast spells) for 3 seconds
- The snared target will have any spell they were casting disrupted
- The archer cannot snare another target for 20 seconds

## Training

Train from Bowyer NPCs to reach around 30.

To gain you will need to repeatedly attack a target, use the razor scavenger to pick up the used arrows from the ground.
