## Combat Advantages

### Range Benefits

## Weapon Special Moves

To help make archers more viable, the shooting delay was reduced to 500ms. However, they remained underpowered due to lack of a special ability. Archers now have the snare ability.

- Requires at least 80 anatomy and 80 archery
- Double-click your equipped bow to toggle snare
- 25% chance to ensnare at 100 anatomy and 100 archery
- Each attempt (failed or successful) uses 15 stamina when active

After a successful snare:

- The snared target cannot move (but can still attack and cast spells) for 3 seconds
- The snared target will have any spell they were casting disrupted
- The archer cannot snare another target for 20 seconds
