# Resisting Spells

## Overview

Resisting Spells reduces the damage taken from harmful spells and shortens the duration of debuffs.

<!-- Not sure if Mana Drain and Mana Vampire have a chance of not having affect at all -->

## Training

You can train Resisting Spells, Magery, Meditation and Healing at the same time.

It's recommended to keep low Evaluating Intelligence as it will increase your spell damage and make training more difficult.
