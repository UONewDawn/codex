# Stats

Understanding your character's core statistics in New Dawn.

## The Three Primary Stats

New Dawn uses three primary statistics that define your character's capabilities:

### Strength (STR)

**Primary Effect:** Hit Points and Physical Damage

---

### Dexterity (DEX)

**Primary Effect:** Stamina and Swing Speed

---

### Intelligence (INT)

**Primary Effect:** Mana Pool

## Stat Distribution

## Stat Caps

**Individual Stat Cap:** 100 (base)
**Total Stat Cap:** 225

!!! info "Stat Growth"
    As you play, your stats will naturally increase toward the 225 cap. You can influence which stats grow by "locking" stats.

## Stat Locks

Control which stats can increase or decrease:

- **Up Arrow (↑)** - Stat can increase
- **Down Arrow (↓)** - Stat can decrease to make room
- **Lock (→)** - Stat is frozen

**Strategy:**

1. Set your primary stats to "up"
2. Set unwanted stats to "down"
3. Lock when you reach desired values
