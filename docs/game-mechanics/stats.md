## Stat Distribution

### Starting Stats

You begin with **80 stat points** to distribute:

**Common Starting Distributions:**

| Build Type | STR | DEX | INT |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|
| Warrior | 50 | 20 | 10 |
| Archer | 45 | 25 | 10 |
| Mage | 10 | 10 | 60 |
| Tamer | 10 | 10 | 60 |
| Crafter | 50 | 20 | 10 |

### Stat Caps

**Individual Stat Cap:** 100 (base)
**Total Stat Cap:** 225

!!! info "Stat Growth"
    As you play, your stats will naturally increase toward the 225 cap. You can influence which stats grow by "locking" stats.

## Stat Locks

Control which stats can increase or decrease:

- **Up Arrow (↑)** - Stat can increase
- **Down Arrow (↓)** - Stat can decrease to make room
- **Lock (→)** - Stat is frozen

**Strategy:**
1. Set your primary stats to "up"
2. Set unwanted stats to "down"
3. Lock when you reach desired values

## Stat Gain

### How Stats Increase

Stats gain through skill usage:

- **Strength:** Melee combat, mining, lumberjacking
- **Dexterity:** Combat (all types), crafting
- **Intelligence:** Spellcasting, meditation

### Stat Gain Rate

- Checks happen during related skill usage
- Higher current stats = slower gains
- Approaching cap = very slow gains
- Random chance on successful actions

!!! tip "Efficient Stat Training"
    - Focus on 2 stats initially
    - Lock stats at desired levels
    - Use stat-gaining skills actively
    - Be patient near stat cap

## Secondary Stats

### Hit Points (HP)

**Formula:** HP = Strength

**Effects:**
- Your health pool
- When it reaches 0, you die
- Can be healed by bandages, spells, potions

**Maximum:** Base 100 (can be increased with items)

---

### Stamina

**Formula:** Stamina = Dexterity

**Effects:**
- Required for running
- Special move costs
- Regenerates over time
- Lowered by armor weight

**Recovery:**
- Passive regeneration (standing/walking)
- Affected by armor weight
- Total refresh potions restore instantly

---

### Mana

**Formula:** Mana = Intelligence

**Effects:**
- Required for spellcasting
- Special abilities cost
- Regenerates slowly (faster with meditation)

**Recovery:**
- Meditation skill (active)
- Passive regeneration (slow)
- Total mana refresh potions
- Spirit speak (if available)

## Stat-Based Calculations

### Melee Damage

Strength directly affects melee weapon damage:

```
Base Damage = (Weapon Damage × (STR + 100)) ÷ 200
```

Higher strength = more damage with melee weapons

### Swing Speed

Dexterity affects how fast you attack:

```
Delay = Base Weapon Speed - (DEX ÷ 25)
```

Higher dexterity = faster attacks

### Spell Damage

Intelligence affects spell power:

```
Spell Damage = Base Spell Damage × (INT ÷ 100)
```

Evaluating Intelligence also significantly affects this
